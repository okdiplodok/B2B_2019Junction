This dashboard designed to monitor profiles of people visiting Finnish national parks and do crowd control is my contribution to the Junction 2019 hackathon. 

Our team worked on the challenge which was aimed to help National parks of Finland to create a more sustainable and nature-friendly experience for its visitors. The challenge description can be found [here](https://2019.hackjunction.com/challenges/finding-ways-to-keep-finlands-national-parks-enjoyable-for-both-foreign-travels-and-locals). Our team has won the 2nd place on our challenge track (Sustainability), yay! :tada:
